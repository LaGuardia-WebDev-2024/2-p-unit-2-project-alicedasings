    <em>(I say mr.sweet boy <br>
    because this is the cover <br>
     to his debut album "Sweet Boy")</em>
    </p> 

        <p>Who's that? It's Malcolm Todd (Myy all time favorite artist).Malcolm arised to the Earth on September 15th, 2003, in L.A. California (Thank God!). <br> 
            Experiencing the pandemic in the middle of high school, he decided to pick up a guitar and just strum a little something. 
            Eventually, he got pretty good and thought, "hey, if I can play guitar, maybe I could sing a little..."
            He started singing and playing stuff with his friends, which is when he met his trusted co-producer and now very good friend Charlie Ziman. <br>

            <p>That's them! What a cute little bromance ðŸ¥° <br>
            The two of them together is great â€” Malcolm drops melodies, Charlie sprinkles magic dust, and it all turns into a fire ass song 
            that'll be stuck in your head.

                Since then, he's been busy making bedroom beats that accidentally went viral on Tik Tok, leading him to being signed by Columbia Records!
                This made him move to NEW YORK CITYYYYY ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘, <br>
